# Computer Algebra computations with Macaulay2
 
This repo contains a series of guided tutorials to perform various tasks in Computer Algebra with Macaulay2.

 keywords:
 Ideals and Rings, Groebner Basis, polynomial systems of equations, computational algebraic geometry
 
 ## How to use
 This material is aimed at people with a basic understanding of algebraic geometry (rings, ideals, algebraic varieties). In each tutorial, a problem is stated at the top and a worked out solutions follows. The learner/reader is strongly advised to attempt to solve the problem alone, before reading the presented solutions.
