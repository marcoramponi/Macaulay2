    "In the ring $\\mathbb{F}_{101}[x_1,x_2,x_3]$ consider 3 generic polynomials of degree 2 and compute its Groebner basis with respect to the lex order. By looking at the structure of resulting polynomials, prove that the system has a finite number of solutions in the algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{F}_{101}$. Can you read the number of solutions the system has off the Groebner basis?  Experiment with 3 polynomials of various degrees, e.g., $(2,2,3)$, $(2,3,3)$ and $(5,5,5)$. State a conjecture about the expected number of solutions of such a system in the general case (any degree).  \n",

Obviously, $V(I)=V(J)$ by construction (we only changed the generating set), so we get at most 8 solutions for our original system of 3 quadric forms $V(I)$.\n",

    "In fact, our conjecture is almost correct. The subtlety here is that the polynomials have to be chooses 'generically' (or 'randomly', in some precise sense) and if we don't do that then we would get infinitely many solutions (for example, in the trivial case where the 3 equations are multiple of each other). With that assumption, the bound is correct! Indeed, a classical result applies:\n",
